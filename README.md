# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this Module challenge is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings on the webpage and dynamic table by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The original webpage could only delivered the user with datetime filter. In this challenge, table is updated with the filters including city, stat, country and shape, so that users can filter the data with more than just a datatime. 

## Results
In the privous webpage in the module, it only included the datetime filter where users added the date and clicked on the filter button for the filtered data to be applied. In the updated webpage, users could simply input the search criteria in one of the filter fields and the webpage will automatically update and display the filtered data as the results. The first screenshot shows the table on the webpage that has not been filtered yet. There are so many type of format and filter field where the filter can be input for the filter to function.

## Summary 
One drawback of this webpage is that the current webpage format is not able to resize depend on the device that is viewed on. Users can manually adjust the size of the images or search box on some portion of the webpage but the webpage couldn't be able to do it as a whole. For future development, one recommendation would be to add formatting that can readjust the webpage format for more device friendly when the page is viewed.

A second recommendation is to add the dropdown button and the input text box in the Filter Search area. Under the dropdown button, multiple criteria such as Date, City, State and so on can be chosen by the user and the text can be filled in the input box. In this way, the table and webpage look cleaner and organzied for visualization purposes.
